# Simple Chatty Bot

This is the 4th project I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track. It was for total beginners, so it took me all of 10 minutes to finish. I didn't learn anything new.

From the project's description (https://hyperskill.org/projects/97):

"Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!"

Topics covered include:
- Python basics
